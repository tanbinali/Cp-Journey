# 🏆 Competitive Programming Archive

Welcome to my personal repository for Competitive Programming (CP). This collection serves as a centralized archive of my solutions, algorithmic studies, and data structure implementations as I sharpen my problem-solving skills.

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my journey through various coding platforms and contests. The primary focus is on writing efficient, optimized code to solve complex algorithmic challenges.

* **Primary Language:** C++ (with occasional Python)

## 📂 Repository Structure

The codebase is organized to reflect my practice across different platforms:

* **Codeforces:** Contest submissions and virtual participation solutions

## 🚀 Profiles & Stats

* **Codeforces:** [mdtanbinali](https://codeforces.com/profile/mdtanbinali)

## 📝 Note

Most solutions are written for competitive environments where execution time and memory usage are paramount. Code style may prioritize speed over strict software engineering patterns.
